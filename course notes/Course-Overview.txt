(a line of text)


Class 1:


What is User Experience? 
The Anatomy of User Experience
Getting Started
Find out who your users are
Creating Personas (exercise)




1.) What is it and why you should care
        -history of the field
        -human computer interaction
        -emotion and user experience
        -making user experience connect to $$



2.) The anatomy of a design
        information architecture
        interaction design
        visual design
        all of this adds up to the user experience


3.) Find out who your users are
        methods
        metrics


4.) Where to begin?
        It’s not rocket surgery
        start small- any testing is better than no testing
        the big comprehensive test as a baseline- pros and cons
        feature by feature testing



5.) Designing a test


6.) Working with users 
        remote or in person
        methods
        2 schools of thought- naturalistic vs structured. finding out whatever it is that users want 
to tell you, vs finding specific things. both have their place
        dos and donts
        if you’re here, you’re probably a nerd, users don’t speak your language
        users have trouble describing what they need in terms you can use
        they will use language that confuses you or is just plain wrong in their efforts to describe things
using non-leading language
using non-technical language

Class 2:

Creating user personas
Identifying Problems
Prioritizing (exercise)
Getting Management Buy-in
User Experience and Project Management Methodology


1.) Creating user personas + exercise


2.) How to know when you have a problem?
        identifying what you want to see happening
        finding out what’s broken


3.) Prioritizing
        if 15 things aren’t working well, how do we decide what to fix first?
        assigning levels to pain points
        fix it now vs fix it later
        band aids vs overhauls

Exercise

4.) Getting buy-in
        how to get company/colleague buy-in- guerrilla testing
        get your results in front of anyone who will listen
        crash meetings if you have to
        methods


5.) User Experience and project management methodology
        -working in a waterfall environment
        -working in an agile environment




Class 3:


Creating a Design: Information Architecture
Creating a Design: Interaction
Creating a Design: Wireframing
Creating a Design: Visual Design






1.) Creating a design: Info architecture
        card sorting
        brainstorming sessions
        hub and spoke diagrams
        language matters- nouns and verbs



exercise: card sorting


2.) Creating a design: Interaction
        flow models
        whiteboards and brainstorming
        what happens next, and then what? and then what?


3.) Creating a design: Wireframing
        
methods:
sketching
        traditional wireframing
        tools
        fireworks/photoshop

exercise: make a rudimentary wireframe based on the card sorting exercise

        
getting feedback:
        iterating on a design
        stakeholder feedback
        user feedback


exercise, break into groups and give feedback

        
4.) Creating a design: Visual design


        adding the pretty on top of your research
        getting feedback
        colors, fonts, images matter
